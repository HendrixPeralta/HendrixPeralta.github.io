                            <p>I developed Ridge regression models for each SDG to evaluate the predictive power of satellite data. The results revealed that some models exhibited strong predictive performance, with SDG 1: "No Poverty" being the best-performing model, achieving a mean R² of 70%. However, other models performed poorly, particularly for SDG 15: "Life on Land" and SDG 16: "Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions." These findings suggest that while satellite data can be a valuable tool for monitoring certain SDG dimensions, ground-level data (e.g., surveys) remains essential for tracking and assessing specific aspects of development. 
                            </p>
                            <p>This study uses satellite data to predict 15 Sustainable Development Indexes at the municipal level. We used the Bolivian SDG Atlas 2020, which includes 15 development dimensions across 339 municipalities. The research highlights the potential of remote sensing data in monitoring SDG progress but also emphasizes the need for complementary ground-level data for certain indicators.

                            <p>Cluster 2 stands out as the region most in need of targeted development interventions, consistently lagging in most development dimensions achievement, except for SDG 13: "Climate Action." This region's underperformance in areas such as SDG 1: "No Poverty" calls for immediate policy attention to address its unique challenges. Conversely, Cluster 3, while excelling in most SDGs, shows a notable underachievement in SDG 13, highlighting a specific area that requires further focus.
                            </p>
                            <p>To identify these regional disparities, we used Agglomerative Clustering to group 339 Bolivian municipalities into five distinct regions based on their performance across 15 development dimensions. The clustering method revealed varying levels of achievement in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across the regions. By examining the resulting clusters, we could pinpoint areas with specific challenges, such as the underperformance of Clusters 2 and 0 in SDG 2 and Cluster 3's struggles with SDG 13. These findings underscore the need for region-specific interventions to improve SDG achievement.

                         <p>Our analysis revealed a complex relationship between the introduction of the subway and traffic-related deaths. Initially, the subway appeared to reduce fatalities, but later, it seemed to have the opposite effect. This suggests that the subway may have led more people to choose walking or cycling as their primary mode of transportation to access the new infrastructure. However, the lack of adequate complementary infrastructure to support these alternative transportation methods may have contributed to the increased risk.</p>
